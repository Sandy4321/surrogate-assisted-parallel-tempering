Surrogate-Assisted Parallel Tempering for Bayesian Neural Learning

We have two major versions 

1. surrogate parallel tempering using random-walk proposal distribution: surrogate_pt_classifier_rw_common_interval.py to run with run_probability_commoninterval.sh
2. surrogate parallel tempering using Langevin gradient proposal distribution: surrogate_pt_classifier_langevingrad.py to run with run_langevin.sh
